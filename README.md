# Lovecraft

Lovecraft is a beautiful two-column theme for bloggers. It features a responsive design, great typography, Block Editor support, a full-width header image (which is replaced with the post thumbnail on single posts/pages), custom accent color support, custom logo support, editor style support, recent posts and recent comments widgets with thumbnails, and a full-width template.

## Contributing
Do you have a bug report or feature request? Feel free to create an issue, and I’ll take a look at it. You can also create a pull request if you have a solution ready. 

Keep in mind that I maintain my themes in my spare time. Even though I deeply appreciate any and all contributions, I can’t guarantee I’ll take a look at them quickly.
